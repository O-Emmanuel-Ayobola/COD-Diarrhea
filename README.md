# COD-Diarrhea
This dataset centers on diarrhea, defined by unusually liquid stools and increased frequency of bowel movements. Such a condition significantly impacts the health outcomes of children, especially those under the age of five, leading to increased rates of sickness and death.
Dataset Overview
This dataset centers on diarrhea, defined by unusually liquid stools and increased frequency of bowel movements. Such a condition significantly impacts the health outcomes of children, especially those under the age of five, leading to increased rates of sickness and death. Compiled by the Inter-Agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation under the United Nations (UN IGME), the dataset consists of 14 columns and 3,315 rows. This report embarks on an exploration of the dataset, starting with basic graphical representations and advancing towards more intricate visual analyses, data mining, and predictive modeling, all while focusing on identifying and interpreting emerging patterns and trends.
The analysis provided in this report starts with an examination of high-level graphical representations derived from the dataset and progressively moves towards more detailed visual analyses, data mining, and predictive efforts. The objective is to scrutinize the dataset for underlying patterns and trends, providing a comprehensive understanding of the data at hand.

The dataset employs a three-letter country code as defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO3) to denote the geographic locations of countries. It encompasses the names of countries and regions that have been analyzed for instances of diarrhea, along with the initial year of data collection.
This dataset is rich in data fields that outline the total number of diarrhea-related fatalities among children. These include cumulative figures of post-neonatal deaths, overall neonatal deaths, and specific neonatal fatalities due to diarrhea, among others. It also presents data on the frequency of deaths attributable to diarrhea. This encompasses the mortality rates of neonatal infants from diarrhea per 1,000 live births, the death rate of post-neonatal infants from diarrhea per 1,000 live births, and the mortality rate of children under five from diarrhea per 1,000 live births.
Furthermore, the dataset details the percentage of deaths due to diarrhea among neonatal deaths, post-neonatal deaths, and deaths of children under five, offering a breakdown into more specific categories.

Initial Data Analysis Using Tableau Visualization Techniques
The initial phase of data analysis involved a systematic approach to collecting, modeling, and examining data to uncover valuable insights that would assist in decision-making. Tailoring the analysis to align with the specific objectives of the company and the study's aims, a range of different strategies, methodologies, and techniques were employed. To uncover patterns, the dataset spanning from 1998 to 2014 was scrutinized using various dimensions and categories suited to its segmentation.
A critical step in enhancing the dataset's integrity was data cleaning, aimed at elevating data quality. This process targeted the identification and correction of any discrepancies or inaccuracies within the data, which could potentially skew the analysis. An error in a data value was identified when it failed to accurately represent the true measurement intended. Utilizing Tableau Data Interpreter, the structure of the dataset was analysed to ensure it was formatted correctly for Tableau analysis, facilitating accurate representation of the analysis outcomes. In this visualization process, depicted in Figure 3, orange and hot pink lines were used to highlight missing data elements. The cleaned dataset, post-processing, is showcased in Figure 4, ready for further analysis.

Data Visualisation
Data visualization stands as a formidable technique for showcasing performance metrics, uncovering trends, understanding the implications of newly implemented strategies, and illustrating various relationships. This methodology not only elevates the efficacy of communication and teamwork but also significantly enriches the content of reports, journalistic endeavors, applications, and any context that necessitates the dissemination of information. Through visualization, subtle trends and patterns, which might remain obscured through mere dataset scrutiny, are brought to light.
In this phase of our analysis, we focus on examining global mortality rates to pinpoint significant trends and make predictions about future directions. This exploration allows us to spotlight critical tendencies and forecast outcomes, offering a comprehensive understanding of the data at hand. The results derived from this stage are detailed below, providing a clear depiction of the insights gained through the art and science of data visualization.

Figure 7 Visualisation 2


The second visualization, presented in Figure 7, showcases the yearly trends of total Post-Neonatal Deaths alongside the fraction of these deaths due to Diarrhea, spanning from 2000 to 2015. This graph reveals a notable increase in the overall count of post-neonatal fatalities while simultaneously illustrating a marked decrease in the percentage of these deaths that can be attributed to diarrhea, from 2016 to 2020. This includes both observed data and forecasted trends. The visualization effectively communicates the changing landscape of post-neonatal mortality, highlighting the specific impact of diarrhea on these trends and projecting future movements based on current and anticipated data. Through this depiction, the visualization makes it possible to comprehend the progress in reducing the proportion of post-neonatal deaths caused by diarrhea amidst the broader context of post-neonatal mortality rates.
